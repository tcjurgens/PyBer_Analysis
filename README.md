# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
In this module, we analyzed CSV files and used Matplotlib to show the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders, and the total ride fares. 

Now, we have been asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
Below, I have added screenshots from my PyBer_Challenge_final_code.ipynb (this script may be found and viewed in the PyBer_Analysis repository) showing the two deliverables of this challenge: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type, and  A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
